This project presents the design and analysis of a compact dual-band microstrip patch antenna operating at 3.5 GHz and 5.6 GHz, targeting modern wireless applications such as 5G and Wi-Fi.
The antenna is fabricated on an FR-4 epoxy substrate (εr = 4.4, thickness = 1.6 mm) and uses dual inverted L-shaped patches along with a defected ground structure (DGS) to achieve multiband performance. 
Simulations performed in Ansys HFSS demonstrate strong impedance matching with return losses of −17 dB at 3.5 GHz and −21 dB at 5.6 GHz, along with stable broadside radiation patterns.
The antenna achieves usable bandwidths of approximately 200 MHz (3.34–3.54 GHz) and 1.36 GHz (4.90–6.26 GHz), making it suitable for WLAN, WiMAX, and IoT wireless devices. 
The proposed design offers a compact size, low cost, and simple fabrication, while maintaining acceptable gain and VSWR performance. 
Minor differences between simulated and measured results were observed due to fabrication tolerances, but overall performance confirms the antenna’s practicality for portable wireless systems.
